### Project Title
Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data


### Description
In this project, I'm making use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Using Python, I will write a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


### Files used
In this project, I will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year


### Questions I'm answering in this project are :
1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    * What is the most common month?
    * What is the most common day of week?
    * What is the most common hour of day?

2. Popular stations and trip
    * What is the most common start station?
    * What is the most common end station?
    * What is the most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)?

4. Trip duration
    * What is the most total travel time?
    * What is the most average travel time?

4. User info
    * What is the counts of each user type?
    * What is the counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)?
    * What is the earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)?


### What software do I need?
To complete this project, i've used the following softwares:
* Python
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
* A terminal application
